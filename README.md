# MediLink
MediLink is an innovative, open-source platform designed to bridge the communication gap in healthcare. Our aim is to ensure seamless exchange of medical information between patients and doctors.

## Key Features

- **Patient Dashboard**: Gives patients control over their medical records. They can view their history, monitor access, and approve or disapprove data requests.

- **Doctor Dashboard**: Allows doctors to access up-to-date medical histories of their patients. It provides a simplified view and the option to request one-time view or update permissions.

MediLink is not just a platform, it's a step towards more transparent, efficient, and patient-centric healthcare.
